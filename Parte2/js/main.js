// Part 2
// Now, create the function getDayNumber.

// It should accept two parameters: janFirstDayNumber and yearDayNumber.

// The yearDayNumber will be an int ranging from 0 to 365.

// janFirstDayNumber will be an int ranging from 0 to 6, representing the day of the week of January 1st.

// Your function should then calculate and return the day of the week corresponding to the yearDayNumber passed.

// Hint: use the remainder operator (%), dividing your yearDayNumber by 7.

function getDayNumber(janFirstDayNumber,yearDayNumber) {
    return janFirstDayNumber + (yearDayNumber-1)%7;
}

console.log("Día de la semana",getDayNumber(0,62));
